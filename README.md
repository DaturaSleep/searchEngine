# searchEngine
Simple search engine with TF-IDF

## Task
The goal of this assignment is to create a simple search engine in Java. The search engine should be implemented
as an inverted index (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) that runs in memory and can return a result
list that is sorted by TF-IDF (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf*idf).

### The search engine should:
* be able to take in a list of documents
* support searches for single terms in the document set (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenization)
* return a list of matching documents sorted by TF-IDF
